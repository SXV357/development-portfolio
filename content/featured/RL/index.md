This project was completed in satisfaction with the capstone project requirements of Inspirit AI's Deep Dives: Designing Deep Learning Systems program as part of a group of 5 people and under the mentorship of a CatapultX Data Scientist. It involves training a reinforcement learning agent with autonomous driving capabilities using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Q-Learning principles. The agent was also fine-tuned to learn from past observations and act upon a known policy to maximize the reward it gains from the environment.
