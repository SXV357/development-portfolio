This project was completed in satisfaction with the capstone project requirements of Inspirit AI's Scholar's program as part of a group of 4 people and under the mentorship of a Physics Masters Student at San Francisco State University. It involves utilizing DarkNet and YOLOv3 to model a processor that makes bounding box and confidence predictions along an autonomous vehicle's path in real-time. The model was fine-tuned using principles of NMS(Non-Maximal-Suppression) to achieve a validation accuracy of about 96%.
